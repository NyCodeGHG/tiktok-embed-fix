# tiktok-embed-fix

Better discord embeds for tiktok links!

## Why
Hey, I know social media companies are evil, but please.
WHY THE **** would you embed a video as an image.
Even with the play button baked right into it. grrr

(My theory is that they want to drive people onto the platform to maximize usage - users viewing the video from the embed won't stick around to _consume more content_. Fair I guess, sorry if I'm ruining that for you)

## How to use
When I feel like it, I'll put instructions here

## How to use (selfhost)
When I feel like it, I'll put instructions here

## Inner workings
When I feel like it, I'll put a neat diagram here

## Contibuting
